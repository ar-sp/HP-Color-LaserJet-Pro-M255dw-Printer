HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw Printer Setup Guide
===============================================

Step 1: Unbox the Printer
-------------------------

Before you can begin the installation process, you need to unbox the HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw carefully. Here's how you can do it:

- **Remove the Printer from the Box:**  
  The printer is usually packed securely in the box, so take your time to remove it carefully. Ensure you place it on a stable surface near a power outlet and your Wi-Fi router if you plan on using a wireless connection.

- **Check the Included Accessories:**  
  Inside the box, you should find the following items:

  - The HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw printer itself.
  - A power cord.
  - Starter toner cartridges (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black).
  - A user manual.
  - A quick setup guide (which you can use for a simplified installation process).

  Ensure that all the accessories are present before continuing.

- **Remove Packaging Materials:**  
  Carefully remove all protective packaging material, such as foam, tape, and plastic wrapping. Be sure to remove any protective pieces from inside the printer, such as the plastic covering on the toner cartridges or the protective seal around the paper tray.

Step 2: Install the Toner Cartridges
------------------------------------

The HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw uses four toner cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow), which need to be installed before the printer is ready for use. Here's how you can install the toner cartridges:

- **Open the Printer’s Front Door:**  
  The toner cartridge compartment is located behind the front access door of the printer. Open the door to access the cartridge slots.

- **Prepare the Toner Cartridges:**  
  Unbox each toner cartridge, ensuring you remove any protective tape and plastic coverings. Be careful not to touch the drum or the contact points on the toner cartridges, as doing so can damage them.

- **Insert the Toner Cartridges:**  
  Insert each toner cartridge into its corresponding slot. Each slot is color-coded to match the toner cartridge (black, cyan, magenta, yellow), making it easy to install them in the correct order.

- **Secure the Toner Cartridges:**  
  Push each cartridge firmly into its slot until you hear a click, indicating it is properly installed.

- **Close the Front Door:**  
  Once all the toner cartridges are securely in place, close the front door of the printer.

Step 3: Load Paper into the Printer
-----------------------------------

Now that the toner cartridges are installed, you need to load paper into the input tray. The HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw supports a variety of paper sizes, including letter, A4, and legal.

- **Pull Out the Input Tray:**  
  Gently slide out the paper input tray from the bottom of the printer.

- **Adjust the Paper Guides:**  
  Adjust the paper width guides in the tray to match the size of paper you are using. If you are using letter-sized paper, ensure that the guides are properly aligned to avoid paper jams.

- **Load the Paper:**  
  Place a stack of paper into the tray, making sure that the paper is aligned properly and that it is not overfilled. Do not exceed the maximum paper limit indicated on the tray.

- **Slide the Tray Back In:**  
  Once the paper is loaded, slide the tray back into place, ensuring it is securely fitted into the printer.

Step 4: Power On the Printer
----------------------------

Now that the toner cartridges are installed, and the paper is loaded, it's time to power on the printer.

- **Plug in the Power Cord:**  
  Insert one end of the power cord into the printer’s power port, and the other end into an electrical outlet.

- **Turn On the Printer:**  
  Press the power button located on the front panel of the printer. The printer will power up and initialize, which may take a few moments. The printer’s control panel will light up, and you’ll be ready for the next steps.
